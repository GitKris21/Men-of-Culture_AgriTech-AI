AI-Driven Decision Support Across the Crop Lifecycle
Overview:
This project is an agentic AI system designed to support farmers with continuous, personalized decision-making across the entire crop lifecycle — from sowing to harvest.
Unlike traditional farming advisory systems that provide one-time or static recommendations, this system continuously observes changing farm conditions, revisits past decisions, and updates advice whenever conditions such as weather or crop stage change.
The goal is to help farmers make timely, context-aware decisions that align with real on-ground conditions.

Problem We Are Solving:
Farmers often rely on delayed, generic, or non-local advice that does not adapt to changing conditions like weather, soil quality, or crop stage. This leads to inefficient resource usage and yield loss.

Our system addresses this by:
Understanding the current state of the farm
Deciding the most important action at that moment
Continuously re-evaluating decisions as conditions evolve
